# monte_carlo_sim

At the [National Kapodistrian University of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_and_Kapodistrian_University_of_Athens), I'm currently enrolled in a postgraduate course about [reinforcement learning](https://www.amazon.com/Reinforcement-Learning-Introduction-Adaptive-Computation/dp/0262039249) and [stochastic games](https://www.amazon.com/Competitive-Markov-Decision-Processes-Jerzy/dp/0387948058), and in a seminar about [Monte Carlo statistical methods](https://www.amazon.com/Monte-Statistical-Methods-Springer-Statistics-dp-1441919392/dp/1441919392). In both of these two courses, I've come across the term "Monte Carlo simulation" multiple times, so I read up on it a little, and I decided that it would be fun to make a software repository, containing implementations of a few Monte Carlo simulators. So far, I have included a [stock price movement simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_prediction) and a [roulette simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette), and I will soon start working on a few others, which I'm actually very excited about.
